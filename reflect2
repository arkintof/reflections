What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	when i initialize a directory with the COMMAND "git init" the directory becomes a repository .
	But git doesnt initally create  a commit so when i press git log it gives an error.
	if i use the COMMAND "git status" then it returns a message telling its a master branch with the files that are not committed.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	between working directory and the repository we have the staging area where the files where the command 
	"git add" stores .this is mainly meant for us to get more flexibility.(stagin area is like a place before commit).
